Star Trek: The Quiz App!

My first real Android app, built with Kotlin. Lets you read up on some of the major starships and captains of Star Trek, then has a quiz page that asks questions about the info. After the quiz there is a page showing how many you got correct.

The app demonstrates my knowledge of
* Basic Kotlin syntax and classes
* Using @Composables from Jetpack Compose
* Using Compose navigation
* Using state via `remember`

Right now the layout only really works in portrait mode. Rotating to landscape mode doesn't look so good yet.
